### **Master Document: Architecture and Implementation of an Autonomous AI Software Development Team**

### **Part 1: System Architecture**

#### **1.1. System Description: Autonomous Software Development Team**

The system is a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** designed to simulate a holistic, intelligent, and efficient software development team. Its primary objective is to take a general requirement from a human user and translate it into a working, documented, and secure software product, managing all stages of the process automatically.

**Core Principles of the System:**

1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The system does not rely on volatile memory. All information—tasks, decisions, code, documentation, and logs—is stored in a structured file and folder system within a **Git repository**. This serves as the "collective brain" of the team, ensuring durability, versioning, and transparency.
2.  **Structured and Hierarchical Communication:** Agents do not communicate freely. Communication is managed by the management agents (primarily the "Conductor" and the "Librarian"), who transfer tasks and deliverables in a defined format between the various agents.
3.  **Task Decomposition:** No agent receives a large, ambiguous task. The system excels at breaking down high-level goals into small, atomic, and measurable tasks, each with a unique identifier, ensuring clarity and focus.
4.  **Verification Loop (Human-in-the-Loop):** No significant deliverable is accepted as "done" without human or automated verification. Code undergoes review and testing, specifications undergo logical validation, and design is checked against requirements. The process only proceeds after explicit approval at designated quality gates.

#### **1.2. The Agent Team Roster**

The team is divided into two functional groups:

**Group A: Management, Orchestration & Control Agents**

*   **The Conductor / Project Manager:** The central orchestrator and human interface.
*   **The Librarian / Documentation & Process Manager:** Manages the project's file system, task IDs, logs, and knowledge base.
*   **The Architect:** The lead technical planner and decision-maker.
*   **The Quality Assurance Guardian:** Validates deliverables and enforces quality standards.
*   **The Git Agent / Configuration Manager:** The dedicated version control specialist.

**Group B: Technical, Execution & Specialist Agents**

*   **The Product Analyst / Specification Writer:** Defines functional requirements.
*   **The UX/UI Designer:** Creates user experience and interface layouts.
*   **The Coder / Developer:** Writes the application code.
*   **The Code Reviewer:** Inspects code for quality, logic, and maintainability.
*   **The Tester:** Writes and executes automated tests.
*   **The DevOps Specialist / Deployment Manager:** Manages infrastructure, CI/CD, and deployment.
*   **The Security Specialist:** Identifies and mitigates security risks.
*   **The Technical Writer:** Creates user and developer documentation.
*   **The Debugger:** A specialized agent for diagnosing and reporting on errors.
*   **The Ask Agent:** A general knowledge agent for answering technical questions.

#### **1.3. Expanded Agent Role Definitions**

(This section details the responsibilities of each agent as defined in their respective `.md` configuration files, incorporating all our corrections and refinements.)

*   **The Conductor:** As the central brain, receives user requests, orchestrates the entire workflow by assigning tasks to other agents, manages dependency loops (e.g., triggering Frontend tasks after Backend completion), and serves as the sole point of contact for human-in-the-loop approval gates.
*   **The Librarian:** Manages the file system source of truth. Assigns unique, version-controlled IDs to all tasks (`TASK-XXX`). Documents every event in `event_log.jsonl`. Provides context to agents on demand. Critically, it is also responsible for **semantic indexing**: after a document is created, the Librarian automatically parses and indexes it into a local vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) to power the team's long-term memory.
*   **The Architect:** As the authoritative technical planner, analyzes specifications to make definitive choices on technology stacks, system architecture, and data models. Produces technical design documents and diagrams. Defines the structure and content of environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `config.staging.json`).
*   **The QA Guardian:** Acts as the final quality gatekeeper. Validates that all deliverables (code, design, specs) align with the original, user-approved requirements and that all automated checks have passed before granting approval for the project to proceed to the next stage.
*   **The Git Agent:** A service agent that executes all version control operations. It creates feature branches, commits code with standardized messages linked to task IDs, and manages the Pull Request lifecycle as instructed by the Conductor or QA Guardian.
*   **The Product Analyst:** Translates high-level user requests into detailed, unambiguous functional specifications and user stories, which serve as the foundation for all subsequent work.
*   **The UX/UI Designer:** Creates visual layouts and user flow diagrams using text-based diagramming languages like **Mermaid.js**. This ensures that designs are version-controllable and can be embedded directly within markdown files (`design_plan.md`), avoiding the need for external graphical tools.
*   **The Coder:** The core executor responsible for writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code that strictly adheres to the provided specifications, design, and architecture.
*   **The Code Reviewer:** Performs high-level code analysis focusing on logic, readability, maintainability, and architectural consistency. This agent assumes basic linting and security scans have been run and focuses on aspects requiring deeper comprehension. It accesses task details to understand the *intent* behind the code.
*   **The Tester:** Writes and runs automated tests (Unit, Integration, E2E) to verify that the code functions as specified. In a TDD workflow, it writes failing tests *before* the Coder writes the implementation.
*   **The DevOps Specialist:** Manages the entire CI/CD process. Packages the application (e.g., into Docker containers), writes deployment scripts, and manages the infrastructure, using the environment-specific configuration files (`config.*.json`) defined by the Architect.
*   **The Security Specialist:** Proactively inspects the project at all stages. Reviews architecture for design flaws, scans code for vulnerabilities (SAST), and checks dependencies for known security issues.
*   **The Technical Writer:** Operates in parallel with development to produce clear documentation for both end-users (guides) and developers (API docs, READMEs).

### **Part 2: System Operations**

#### **2.1. Universal Behavior Protocol (The Constitution)**

These are the mandatory operating procedures for all agents. Enforcement is not left to the agents themselves but is **built into the Agent Runner/Orchestrator's execution loop**. This system-level enforcement ensures consistency and reliability.

1.  **Task Start Protocol ("Onboarding"):** Before any agent is activated, the Orchestrator automatically gathers full context from the Librarian and provides it. The agent then analyzes this context, asks clarifying questions if needed, and must receive an explicit "go-ahead" from the Conductor before beginning work.
2.  **Communication & Dependency Protocol ("Ask, Don't Assume"):** If an agent encounters ambiguity, it halts and returns a "waiting for clarification" status. The Orchestrator forwards the query to the Conductor for resolution.
3.  **Task Completion Protocol ("Definition of Done"):** Upon completion, the agent's output is checked against a pre-defined checklist by the Orchestrator before the workflow can advance.
4.  **Error Handling Protocol ("Fail Gracefully"):** If an agent fails, the Orchestrator catches the error, documents it with full logs in the task's directory, and can trigger a recovery process (e.g., assign a task to the Debugger agent).
5.  **Focus Maintenance Protocol ("Single Responsibility"):** Each agent's prompt strictly defines its scope. The QA Guardian validates that deliverables do not exceed this scope.
6.  **Dependency Management Protocol ("Supply Chain"):** Adding any new external library requires a formal approval process involving the Architect and Security Specialist.
7.  **Confidentiality Protocol ("Need to Know"):** Secrets are never stored in Git. Code refers only to environment variables, which are injected at runtime by the DevOps Specialist.
8.  **Self-Documenting Protocol:** A strict requirement for descriptive naming conventions, in-code documentation (docstrings), and commit messages that explain the "why."

#### **2.2. System Toolbox (Tools)**

(This is the full list of functions available to the agents, with access controlled by the Orchestrator based on the agent's role.)

*   **Universal & General Tools:**
    *   File Management: `read_file`, `write_file`, `append_to_file`, `list_files`, `create_directory`
    *   Task & Process Management: `get_task_details`, `update_task_status`, `record_log`
    *   Search & Communication: `semantic_search_documentation`, `search_in_files`, `ask_human_for_clarification`, `get_current_datetime`
*   **Dedicated & Specific Tools:**
    *   Project Management (for Conductor): `create_new_task`, `assign_task_to_agent`, `notify_agent`
    *   Version Control (for Git Agent): `git_create_branch`, `git_add_and_commit`, `git_push`, `git_create_pull_request`
    *   Command Execution & Testing (for Coder, Tester, DevOps): `execute_shell_command`, `run_tests`, `lint_code`
    *   Security & Secrets (for Security, DevOps): `run_security_scan`, `check_dependencies`, `get_environment_variable`

#### **2.3. Full Workflows with Integrated Controls**

**Workflow 1: Simple Linear Feature (e.g., CSV Export)**

1.  **Step 0: Request:** Human user submits the request to the Conductor.
2.  **Step 1: Planning:** Conductor assigns tasks to the Analyst and Architect, who produce `spec.md` and `architecture.md` after completing their "Task Start Protocol."
3.  **Step 2: Human Approval Gate:** Conductor tasks the Analyst to create a summary. The Conductor presents this summary to the human user via `ask_human_for_clarification` and pauses the workflow until a "Yes" is received.
4.  **Step 3: TDD Development:**
    *   Conductor assigns a test-writing task to the Tester, who gets a go-ahead, creates a Git branch, and commits a failing test.
    *   Conductor assigns a code-writing task to the Coder, who gets a go-ahead and writes the code to make the test pass, then commits.
    *   Conductor assigns a review task to the Code Reviewer, who approves the code.
5.  **Step 4: Integration:** QA Guardian verifies all steps are complete and instructs the Git Agent to create and merge the Pull Request. Conductor closes the task and reports to the user.

**Workflow 2: Complex UI Feature (e.g., User Profile Page)**

1.  **Step 0: Request:** User submits the request to the Conductor.
2.  **Step 1: Multi-layered Planning:** The Analyst, UX/UI Designer (using Mermaid.js), and Architect produce their respective planning documents. The Architect also defines environment config files.
3.  **Step 2: Human Approval Gate:** The Conductor presents a comprehensive summary, including the embedded Mermaid diagram, to the user for approval. The workflow pauses, allowing for revision cycles based on user feedback.
4.  **Step 3: Parallel Development:** After approval, the Conductor creates two parallel main tasks: `TASK-009` (Backend API) and `TASK-010` (Frontend UI).
    *   The Backend team develops and completes the API in its own branch.
    *   The Frontend team develops the UI in its branch, using mock data based on the approved API contract.
5.  **Step 4: Integration, Deployment, and Completion:**
    *   The Backend task (`TASK-009`) is completed and merged.
    *   **The Conductor identifies this dependency completion.** It creates a new sub-task, `SUB-010.2: Integrate with live API`, and assigns it to the Frontend Coder.
    *   The Frontend Coder connects the UI to the real API. All parts are tested and merged.
    *   The Conductor assigns a deployment task to the DevOps Specialist, who uses `config.staging.json` to deploy to a staging environment.
    *   The Conductor presents the staging link to the human for final UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
    *   Upon final approval, the Conductor instructs the DevOps Specialist to deploy to Production. The project is marked as complete.
