print(f"Average duration: {stats['avg_duration']:.1f}s")

# Find similar experiences for guidance
similar = await experience_db.get_similar_experiences(
    context={"language": "python", "complexity": "high"},
    task_type=TaskType.CODE_GENERATION
)

# Get pattern-based recommendations
recommendations = await experience_db.get_recommendations(
    context=current_context,
    task_type=current_task_type
)
```

#### 🔍 Pattern Recognition Results

From recent analysis of 100+ agent experiences:

- **Success Patterns**: 10+ identified optimal action sequences
