# Agent Prompt Templates with Handoff Packet System

## Universal Agent Instructions

All agents must follow these standardized output requirements:

### Handoff Packet Format
Every agent must end their work with a structured handoff packet in JSON format:

```json
{
  "completed_task_id": "TASK-XXX or SUB-XXX.X",
  "agent_name": "Agent_Name",
  "status": "SUCCESS|FAILURE|PENDING|BLOCKED",
  "artifacts_produced": ["file1.py", "file2.md"],
  "next_step_suggestion": "CODE_REVIEW|IMPLEMENTATION_NEEDED|TESTING_NEEDED|MERGE_APPROVED|etc",
  "notes": "Detailed explanation of work completed and any issues",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T03:30:00",
  "dependencies_satisfied": ["DEP-001", "DEP-002"],
  "blocking_issues": ["Issue description if any"]
}
```

### Next Step Suggestions
- **CODE_REVIEW**: Code has been written and needs review
- **IMPLEMENTATION_NEEDED**: Tests written, need implementation
- **TESTING_NEEDED**: Code written, needs tests
- **MERGE_APPROVED**: Ready for merge after QA approval
- **DEPLOY_TO_STAGING**: Ready for staging deployment
- **DEPLOY_TO_PRODUCTION**: Ready for production deployment
- **HUMAN_APPROVAL_NEEDED**: Requires human decision
- **DOCUMENTATION_NEEDED**: Requires documentation
- **SECURITY_SCAN_NEEDED**: Needs security review
- **DEBUG_NEEDED**: Issues found, debugging required
