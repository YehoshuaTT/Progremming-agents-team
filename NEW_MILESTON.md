### **Project Horizon: Roadmap for Advanced Capabilities and System Maturity (Revised)**

**Document Objective:** Following the successful implementation of the agent integration and intelligent orchestration plan, this document outlines the next strategic phases. The focus now shifts from establishing the team's collaborative workflow to enhancing its performance, expanding its problem-solving abilities, and preparing it for real-world application.

---

### **Part 1: Performance, Efficiency, and Reliability (Hardening)**

This phase focuses on making the existing system more resilient, predictable, and maintainable.

**Step 1: Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage for the System Itself**

*   **Objective:** Create a robust suite of automated tests for the **entire agent framework** (the Orchestrator, tools, and agent interactions). This ensures that future enhancements or refactoring do not break existing functionality (regression). This is the safety net for all subsequent development.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Unit Tests for All Tools:**
        *   Create a dedicated `tests/` directory.
        *   For every function in your `tools/` directory (e.g., `write_file`, `git_create_branch`), write a corresponding unit test file (e.g., `tests/test_file_tools.py`).
        *   These tests will run in isolation and verify that each tool works as expected (e.g., does `write_file` actually create a file with the correct content?). Use Python's `unittest` or `pytest` framework.
    2.  **Integration Tests for Core Agent Interactions:**
        *   Write tests that simulate a simple, two-agent interaction. For example, a test that runs the **Analyst** to create a spec file, and then runs the **Coder** to read that same file. This tests the integration between agents and the file system source of truth.
        *   Mock the LLM API calls in these tests. The goal is not to test the LLM's intelligence, but to test the *plumbing* of your system (i.e., that the output from one agent is correctly passed as input to the next).
    3.  **Tests for the Orchestrator's Routing Logic:**
        *   Write specific unit tests for the `route_next_task` function. Create mock "Handoff Packets" and assert that the router chooses the correct next step for each scenario (e.g., a packet with `next_step_suggestion: "CODE_REVIEW"` should trigger the `Code Reviewer` and `Security Specialist`).
    4.  **CI (Continuous Integration) Integration:**
        *   Set up a simple CI pipeline using a free service like **GitHub Actions**.
        *   Configure this pipeline to automatically run your entire test suite on every `push` to the Git repository. A Pull Request will be blocked from merging if any test fails.

**Step 1.5: Implement a Multi-Layered Context and "Drill-Down" System for Token Optimization**

*   **Objective:** Dramatically reduce token consumption by avoiding the submission of entire documents as context. Instead, provide agents with high-level summaries and give them the *ability* to "drill down" into specific details only when necessary.
*   **The Problem This Solves:** Currently, to provide context, we might feed an entire `spec.md` file to the Coder agent. This is inefficient if the Coder only needs to know about a single function defined within it. This new system will provide context "just-in-time" and "just-enough".

*   **How It Will Be Implemented (The "Summary -> Drill-Down" Architecture):**

    1.  **Automatic Summary Generation (The "L0" Layer):**
        *   This will be a new responsibility for the **Librarian** agent.
        *   Whenever a new major artifact is created (e.g., `spec.md`, `architecture.md`), the Librarian will automatically trigger a sub-task.
        *   This sub-task uses a specialized LLM call to generate a structured summary of the document. The summary will not just be text, but a **structured map** of the document's sections.
        *   **Example Output (`spec.md.summary.json`):**
            ```json
            {
              "document_title": "Specification for User Profile Page",
              "overall_summary": "This document outlines the features of the user profile page, including data display and user interactions.",
              "sections": [
                {
                  "section_id": "SPEC-SEC-001",
                  "title": "User Data Display",
                  "summary": "Defines which user fields (name, email, join date) are displayed.",
                  "token_count_estimate": 150
                },
                {
                  "section_id": "SPEC-SEC-002",
                  "title": "Post List",
                  "summary": "Specifies the display of the user's 10 most recent posts, including title and timestamp.",
                  "token_count_estimate": 300
                },
                {
                  "section_id": "SPEC-SEC-003",
                  "title": "API Requirements",
                  "summary": "Details the required GET endpoint and its expected JSON response structure.",
                  "token_count_estimate": 250
                }
              ]
            }
            ```
        *   This summary file is saved alongside the original document.

    2.  **A New "Drill-Down" Tool:**
        *   We will create a new, critical tool available to all agents: `get_document_section(document_path, section_id)`.
        *   This tool takes the path to the original document and a `section_id` from the summary file.
        *   It then programmatically extracts and returns *only the text of that specific section* from the full document.

    3.  **Refactoring the Agent Workflow:**
        *   The **Orchestrator's** context-gathering process will be updated. Instead of feeding the agent the full content of `spec.md`, it will now feed it the content of `spec.md.summary.json`.
        *   The **Agent Prompts** will be updated with a new instruction:
            > "You will be provided with a structured summary of relevant documents. This is your 'Table of Contents'. Analyze this summary first. If the summary provides enough information to proceed, do so. If you require the full details of a specific section, use the `get_document_section` tool with the appropriate `section_id` to retrieve only the information you need. **Do not ask to read the full file unless absolutely necessary.**"

*   **Example of the New Workflow in Action:**
    1.  The **Coder** agent receives a task: "Implement the API for the user profile page."
    2.  The Orchestrator provides it with the content of `spec.md.summary.json`.
    3.  **Coder's Thought Process:** "My task is about the API. I see a section in the summary with `section_id: 'SPEC-SEC-003'` titled 'API Requirements'. The summary isn't detailed enough. I need the full text of that section."
    4.  **Coder's Action:** `<tool_code>get_document_section(document_path='tasks/TASK-005/spec.md', section_id='SPEC-SEC-003')</tool_code>`
    5.  **Result:** The Coder receives only the ~250 tokens detailing the API requirements, instead of the entire 700-token document.
    6.  The Coder now has the precise context it needs and proceeds to write the code.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Massive Token/Cost Reduction:** This is the primary benefit. Context size is drastically reduced.
    *   **Improved Focus and Accuracy:** The LLM is given a smaller, more relevant context, which reduces the chance of "hallucination" or getting confused by irrelevant parts of the document.
    *   **Faster Performance:** Smaller prompts lead to faster API response times.

### **Part 3: Towards Full Autonomy and Usability**

This phase focuses on making the system a truly usable tool.

**Step 7: Develop a User Interface (UI) for the Orchestrator**

*   **Objective:** Replace the command-line interaction with a simple graphical interface.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Design the UI:** Use the agent team itself to design its own UI...
    2.  **Build the UI:** Use the agent team to build the interface...

**Step 8: Conduct a "Red Team" Exercise**

*   **Objective:** Proactively find the system's weaknesses and failure points.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Define "Red Team" Scenarios:** Create a list of challenging or intentionally ambiguous requests...
    2.  **Run the Scenarios and Analyze:** Execute these tasks, log the failures, and use the logs to harden the system's logic and prompts.


### **Part 4: Meta-System and Self-Improvement Capabilities**

This phase moves beyond just using the system to building things, and into having the system **improve and manage itself**. The successful implementation of testing and reporting provides the data needed for this evolution.

**Step 9: Implement an Automated "System Health" Agent**

*   **Objective:** Create a dedicated agent that continuously monitors the health and performance of the *agent team itself*, not just the application it builds.
*   **Trigger:** This agent runs automatically after the completion of every project (or on a nightly basis).
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Consume Test and Demo Reports:** The `System Health Agent` will be tasked with reading and parsing the outputs of `integration_test.py` and `final_demonstration.py`.
    2.  **Analyze Performance Trends:** Instead of just reporting the latest success rate, this agent will **track trends over time**. It will answer questions like: "Is the average task completion time increasing?", "Is the `Coder` agent starting to fail more often than last week?", "Did the success rate drop after the last change to the `Orchestrator`?".
    3.  **Generate Proactive Alerts:** If a negative trend is detected (e.g., success rate drops below 98%, a specific test starts failing intermittently), the agent will automatically create a high-priority task for the **human overseer** or a `Debugger` agent, complete with all the relevant data and logs. This moves the system from being reactive to being proactive.

**Step 10: Develop a "Self-Healing" Capability for the Agents**

*   **Objective:** Enable the system to automatically fix minor, recurring issues within its own operational logic.
*   **Prerequisite:** The "System Health Agent" from Step 9 must be operational to identify recurring problems.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Identify a Recurring, Simple Failure:** The `System Health Agent` might detect that the `UX/UI Designer` agent frequently fails because it uses an outdated Mermaid.js syntax.
    2.  **Trigger a "Self-Correction" Workflow:** The `System Health Agent` notifies the **Conductor** about this recurring, low-risk issue.
    3.  **The Conductor's Meta-Task:** The Conductor initiates a new, internal project with the goal: "The `UX/UI Designer` agent's prompt is causing failures. Update the `UX_UI_Designer.md` file to instruct the agent to use the latest Mermaid.js syntax."
    4.  **The Team Fixes Itself:**
        *   The **Technical Writer** agent is tasked to find the correct, modern Mermaid syntax (using its `web_search` tool).
        *   It then updates the `UX_UI_Designer.md` prompt file with the corrected instructions.
        *   The **QA Guardian** runs a test case specifically designed to fail with the old prompt and pass with the new one.
    5.  **Closing the Loop:** The system has now automatically updated its own "source code" (its prompts) to prevent a future failure, demonstrating a true learning and self-healing capability.
