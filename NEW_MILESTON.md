### **Project Horizon: Roadmap for Advanced Capabilities and System Maturity (Revised)**

**Document Objective:** Following the successful implementation of the agent integration and intelligent orchestration plan, this document outlines the next strategic phases. The focus now shifts from establishing the team's collaborative workflow to enhancing its performance, expanding its problem-solving abilities, and preparing it for real-world application.

### **Part 1: Performance, Efficiency, and Reliability (Hardening)**

This phase focuses on making the existing system more resilient, predictable, and maintainable.

**Step 1: Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage for the System Itself**

*   **Objective:** Create a robust suite of automated tests for the **entire agent framework** (the Orchestrator, tools, and agent interactions). This ensures that future enhancements or refactoring do not break existing functionality (regression). This is the safety net for all subsequent development.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Unit Tests for All Tools:**
        *   Create a dedicated `tests/` directory.
        *   For every function in your `tools/` directory (e.g., `write_file`, `git_create_branch`), write a corresponding unit test file (e.g., `tests/test_file_tools.py`).
        *   These tests will run in isolation and verify that each tool works as expected (e.g., does `write_file` actually create a file with the correct content?). Use Python's `unittest` or `pytest` framework.
    2.  **Integration Tests for Core Agent Interactions:**
        *   Write tests that simulate a simple, two-agent interaction. For example, a test that runs the **Analyst** to create a spec file, and then runs the **Coder** to read that same file. This tests the integration between agents and the file system source of truth.
        *   Mock the LLM API calls in these tests. The goal is not to test the LLM's intelligence, but to test the *plumbing* of your system (i.e., that the output from one agent is correctly passed as input to the next).
    3.  **Tests for the Orchestrator's Routing Logic:**
        *   Write specific unit tests for the `route_next_task` function. Create mock "Handoff Packets" and assert that the router chooses the correct next step for each scenario (e.g., a packet with `next_step_suggestion: "CODE_REVIEW"` should trigger the `Code Reviewer` and `Security Specialist`).
    4.  **CI (Continuous Integration) Integration:**
        *   Set up a simple CI pipeline using a free service like **GitHub Actions**.
        *   Configure this pipeline to automatically run your entire test suite on every `push` to the Git repository. A Pull Request will be blocked from merging if any test fails.

**Step 2: Implement Caching and Memoization**

*   **Objective:** Drastically reduce redundant LLM calls and tool executions, which are the primary drivers of cost and latency.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **LLM Call Caching:** Implement a persistent cache for LLM calls...
    2.  **Tool Output Caching:** Implement caching for deterministic tools...
    3.  **Handoff Packet Caching:** Cache the "Handoff Packets"...

**Step 3: Develop Advanced Error Handling and Recovery Strategies**

*   **Objective:** Make the system capable of recovering from failures without requiring a full manual restart.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Implement Task Checkpointing:** ...
    2.  **Create an Automatic Retry Mechanism:** ...
    3.  **Introduce the "Debugger" Agent into the Workflow:** ...

### **Part 2: Expanding System Intelligence and Capability**

This phase focuses on making the agents smarter and the overall process more sophisticated.

**Step 4: Refine Security Posture**

*   **Objective:** Minimize the system's attack surface.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Implement a "Sandboxed" Execution Environment:** ...
    2.  **Create a Command Whitelist/Blacklist:** ...

**Step 5: Implement a "Memory" System for Continuous Learning**

*   **Objective:** Enable the agent team to learn from past projects to improve future performance.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Create a "Solutions Archive":** ...
    2.  **Enhance the `get_project_context` Tool:** ...
    3.  **Incorporate Past Feedback:** ...

**Step 6: Grant the Ability to Browse and Learn from the Internet**

*   **Objective:** Allow agents to solve problems that require external knowledge.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Implement a Secure Web Browsing Tool:** ...
    2.  **Implement a Web Search Tool:** ...
    3.  **Update Agent Prompts:** ...

### **Part 3: Towards Full Autonomy and Usability**

This phase focuses on making the system a truly usable tool.

**Step 7: Develop a User Interface (UI) for the Orchestrator**

*   **Objective:** Replace the command-line interaction with a simple graphical interface.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Design the UI:** Use the agent team itself to design its own UI...
    2.  **Build the UI:** Use the agent team to build the interface...

**Step 8: Conduct a "Red Team" Exercise**

*   **Objective:** Proactively find the system's weaknesses and failure points.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Define "Red Team" Scenarios:** Create a list of challenging or intentionally ambiguous requests...
    2.  **Run the Scenarios and Analyze:** Execute these tasks, log the failures, and use the logs to harden the system's logic and prompts.


### **Part 4: Meta-System and Self-Improvement Capabilities**

This phase moves beyond just using the system to building things, and into having the system **improve and manage itself**. The successful implementation of testing and reporting provides the data needed for this evolution.

**Step 9: Implement an Automated "System Health" Agent**

*   **Objective:** Create a dedicated agent that continuously monitors the health and performance of the *agent team itself*, not just the application it builds.
*   **Trigger:** This agent runs automatically after the completion of every project (or on a nightly basis).
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Consume Test and Demo Reports:** The `System Health Agent` will be tasked with reading and parsing the outputs of `integration_test.py` and `final_demonstration.py`.
    2.  **Analyze Performance Trends:** Instead of just reporting the latest success rate, this agent will **track trends over time**. It will answer questions like: "Is the average task completion time increasing?", "Is the `Coder` agent starting to fail more often than last week?", "Did the success rate drop after the last change to the `Orchestrator`?".
    3.  **Generate Proactive Alerts:** If a negative trend is detected (e.g., success rate drops below 98%, a specific test starts failing intermittently), the agent will automatically create a high-priority task for the **human overseer** or a `Debugger` agent, complete with all the relevant data and logs. This moves the system from being reactive to being proactive.

**Step 10: Develop a "Self-Healing" Capability for the Agents**

*   **Objective:** Enable the system to automatically fix minor, recurring issues within its own operational logic.
*   **Prerequisite:** The "System Health Agent" from Step 9 must be operational to identify recurring problems.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Identify a Recurring, Simple Failure:** The `System Health Agent` might detect that the `UX/UI Designer` agent frequently fails because it uses an outdated Mermaid.js syntax.
    2.  **Trigger a "Self-Correction" Workflow:** The `System Health Agent` notifies the **Conductor** about this recurring, low-risk issue.
    3.  **The Conductor's Meta-Task:** The Conductor initiates a new, internal project with the goal: "The `UX/UI Designer` agent's prompt is causing failures. Update the `UX_UI_Designer.md` file to instruct the agent to use the latest Mermaid.js syntax."
    4.  **The Team Fixes Itself:**
        *   The **Technical Writer** agent is tasked to find the correct, modern Mermaid syntax (using its `web_search` tool).
        *   It then updates the `UX_UI_Designer.md` prompt file with the corrected instructions.
        *   The **QA Guardian** runs a test case specifically designed to fail with the old prompt and pass with the new one.
    5.  **Closing the Loop:** The system has now automatically updated its own "source code" (its prompts) to prevent a future failure, demonstrating a true learning and self-healing capability.
