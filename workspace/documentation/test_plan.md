# Test Plan: User Profile Feature

**Objective:** To verify the correct implementation and functionality of the User Profile feature, including frontend and backend components.

## 1. Automated Tests

### 1.1. Frontend Unit Tests

- **Tool:** Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Location:** `workspace/frontend/src/components/UserProfile.test.tsx`
- **Assertions:**
  - The `UserProfile` component renders without crashing.
  - The component displays the main heading "User Profile".
  - The component correctly fetches and displays a list of users.
  - The number of displayed users matches the number of users returned from the service.
  - The username and email for each user are correctly displayed.

### 1.2. Backend Unit Tests

- **Tool:** Pytest
- **Location:** `workspace/backend/tests/test_app.py`
- **Status:** âœ… PASSED
- **Assertions:**
  - The `/api/users` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status code.
  - The endpoint returns a JSON array of users.
  - The returned user objects have the expected `id`, `username`, and `email` fields.
  - The number of users returned matches the seeded test data (2 users).

## 2. Manual End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Objective:** To verify the complete workflow from the user's perspective.
- **Setup:**
  1. Start the backend server.
  2. Start the frontend development server.
  3. Open the application in a web browser (`http://localhost:5173`).

- **Test Cases:**

  | Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | E2E-001 | View User Profile Page | 1. Navigate to the application URL. | The User Profile page loads and displays a list of users fetched from the backend. | The page loaded correctly and displayed user data. | Passed |
  | E2E-002 | Verify User Data | 1. Inspect the displayed user list. | The user data on the page matches the data in the `user` table of the database. | User data matches the seed data in the database. | Passed |

## 3. Performance Tests (Future)

- **Objective:** To ensure the application performs well under load.
- **Tests:**
  - Measure the API response time for the `/api/users` endpoint.
  - Measure the page load time for the User Profile page.

## 4. Security Tests (Future)

- **Objective:** To identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Tests:**
  - Test for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
  - Ensure that the API endpoints are properly secured.
