# Code Review Request: User Profile Page Feature

## Summary
This code review request covers the complete implementation of the "User Profile Page" feature as part of the **Complex UI Feature** workflow defined in our master plan. The feature includes both backend API development and frontend React component implementation, along with comprehensive testing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Development (Flask API)
- **File:** `workspace/backend/app/routes.py`
- **Changes:** Added `GET /api/users` endpoint to return all users
- **File:** `workspace/backend/app/models.py`
- **Changes:** User model with `to_dict()` method for JSON serialization
- **File:** `workspace/backend/app/__init__.py`
- **Changes:** Application factory pattern with separate configs for development and testing

### 2. Frontend Development (React + Vite)
- **File:** `workspace/frontend/src/components/UserProfile.tsx`
- **Changes:** React component that fetches and displays user data from the backend API
- **File:** `workspace/frontend/src/services/userService.ts`
- **Changes:** API service to handle HTTP requests to the backend
- **File:** `workspace/frontend/src/mocks/users.ts`
- **Changes:** Mock data for testing and development

### 3. Testing Implementation
- **Frontend Tests:** `workspace/frontend/src/components/UserProfile.test.tsx`
  - Uses Vitest and React Testing Library
  - Tests component rendering and data display
  - Status: ✅ PASSED
- **Backend Tests:** `workspace/backend/tests/test_app.py`
  - Uses Pytest and Flask test client
  - Tests API endpoint functionality
  - Status: ✅ PASSED

### 4. Configuration & Setup
- **Frontend:** Vite configuration with testing setup
- **Backend:** Flask application factory with separate configurations for development and testing
- **Database:** SQLite for testing, PostgreSQL for development

## Test Results
- **Frontend Unit Tests:** ✅ 1 test passed
- **Backend Unit Tests:** ✅ 1 test passed
- **Manual E2E Tests:** ✅ 2 test cases passed
- **Integration:** Frontend successfully communicates with backend API

## Code Quality Checklist
