# Agent Context Management Strategy - Enhanced Version

This document outlines the enhanced strategy for managing and passing context between agents in the autonomous software development system. The primary goal is to ensure seamless, stateful collaboration while preventing context overload through a **layered context management approach**.

## 1. Problem Statement

As tasks are handed off between multiple specialized agents over several iterations, several main challenges arise:

1.  **Context Loss**: An agent receiving a task might not have the full history of previous decisions, artifacts, and user feedback, leading to redundant work or errors.
2.  **Context Overload**: Passing the entire raw history (every prompt, response, and discussion) to each agent becomes inefficient and computationally expensive. The context window of the LLM can be exceeded, and the agent may struggle to identify the most relevant information.
3.  **Context Corruption**: If an agent fails mid-operation, it may leave the context in an inconsistent state.
4.  **Cost Escalation**: Unlimited context growth leads to escalating LLM costs.
5.  **Information Recovery**: Critical information from previous phases may be oversummarized and lost.

The key requirement is to create a system where every agent has the complete, relevant context in a structured and concise format, focusing on technical decisions and actionable commands rather than verbose, conversational text.

## 2. Core Solution: The "Task Story" JSON Object with Layered Management

The solution uses a single, structured JSON object as a "living document" or "story" for each task, combined with a **two-level context management strategy**:

- **Level 1 (Within-Phase)**: Light compression maintaining technical detail for agents in the same phase
- **Level 2 (Phase-Transition)**: Heavy compression summarizing only key deliverables for the next phase

## 3. Enhanced Context_Summarizer Agent

The specialized `Context_Summarizer` agent addresses context overload with smart timing and robust validation:

-   **Trigger Strategy**: 
    - Level 1: Every 3-4 agent handoffs (not every single handoff - cost optimization)
    - Level 2: At major phase transitions (Planning → Implementation → Testing → Deployment)
-   **Input**: The full "Task Story" JSON object
-   **Process**: Applies appropriate compression level based on context
-   **Output**: Updated JSON with compressed context
-   **Validation**: Tests against predefined complex examples to prevent information loss
-   **Fallback**: Escape Hatch mechanism for critical information recovery

## 4. Context Integrity and Safety Mechanisms

### 4.1 Commit/Snapshot System
- **Working Copies**: Agents receive a working copy of the TaskStory object
- **Atomic Commits**: Changes are saved only upon successful completion
- **Rollback**: Failed operations don't corrupt the main context
- **Version Control**: Track TaskStory versions for debugging and recovery

### 4.2 Escape Hatch Mechanism
When the Context_Summarizer over-compresses and loses critical information:
- **Command**: `"EXPAND_CONTEXT from [Agent_Name] in [Phase_Name]"`
- **Use Case**: Next phase agent discovers missing critical technical detail
- **Cost Warning**: System shows estimated cost before expansion
- **Limits**: Maximum 2 expansions per agent per phase

### 4.3 Validation and Testing
- **Test Suite**: 5-10 complex JSON examples for regular validation
- **Integrity Checks**: Pre-commit validation of TaskStory structure
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track context management costs (target: <10% of total)
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor information retention across summarizations

## 5. Enhanced JSON Structure with Safety Features

The following structure was designed to be comprehensive while supporting the new safety and efficiency mechanisms:

```json
{
  "task_id": "string",
  "status": "string (e.g., IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)",
  "context_metadata": {
    "version": "number (for version control)",
    "last_commit": "datetime",
    "summarization_level": "string (WITHIN_PHASE | PHASE_TRANSITION)",
    "cost_tracking": {
      "total_context_operations": "number",
      "estimated_cost": "number"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "objective": "string (A detailed description of the overall goal)",
    "current_phase": "string (PLANNING | IMPLEMENTATION | TESTING | DEPLOYMENT)",
    "decisions": [
      {
        "agent": "string (e.g., Architect, Coder)",
        "timestamp": "datetime",
        "description": "string (A summary of the decision made)",
        "commands": [
          "string (Actionable commands, including TODO/NOT TODO)"
        ],
        "methods": [
          "string (Specific function/method names or code snippets)"
        ],
        "notes": "string (Additional context, e.g., user requests)",
        "execution_summary": "string (Agent's summary of actual execution, issues, insights)",
        "recommendations": ["string (Agent's suggestions for next steps)"]
      }
    ],
    "artifacts": ["string (List of created/modified file paths)"],
    "dependencies": ["string (List of libraries or other tasks)"],
    "phase_summaries": {
      "planning": "string (Heavy compression of planning phase)",
      "implementation": "string (Heavy compression of implementation phase)",
      "testing": "string (Heavy compression of testing phase)"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "escape_hatch_log": [
        {
          "requested_by": "string (agent name)",
          "requested_context": "string (what was requested)",
          "timestamp": "datetime"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Complex Example: "Smart Reminders" Feature

The following example demonstrates how the JSON object evolves as it passes through different agents, including handling a change in requirements from the user mid-process.

### Narrative Flow

1.  **Product Analyst**: Defines the initial feature for smart reminders based on time and location.
2.  **User**: Intervenes and requests the addition of voice reminders (TTS).
3.  **Architect**: Designs the technical solution using Location APIs, Firebase, and a TTS service.
4.  **Librarian**: Manages and documents the new dependencies.
5.  **Coder**: Implements the `SmartReminder` class.
6.  **Code Reviewer**: Reviews the code and requests error handling improvements.
7.  **QA Guardian**: Tests the feature and identifies a bug in the voice reminder implementation.
8.  **Tester**: Writes unit and integration tests.
9.  **UX/UI Designer**: Designs the user interface elements for the new feature.
10. **DevOps Specialist**: Plans the gradual rollout of the feature to production.

## 6. Layered Context Management Strategy

### The Reality Check
Initial planning suggested 2000 tokens per handoff, but this is unrealistic for complex projects. Context naturally grows as:
- More agents contribute decisions
- Technical complexity increases  
- Dependencies and artifacts accumulate
- User feedback and iterations add layers

### Two-Level Compression Approach

#### Level 1: Within-Phase Context (< 4000 tokens)
For agents working within the same project phase (Planning, Implementation, Testing):
- Keep full technical details and recent decisions
- Remove redundant discussions and old iterations
- Maintain complete TODO chains and method references
- Preserve user feedback and critical notes

#### Level 2: Phase Transition Context (< 1500 tokens)  
When transitioning between major project phases:
- Focus on "what was built" rather than "how decisions were made"
- Summarize final implementations and key artifacts
- List dependencies and known issues
- Provide next phase focus areas

### Updated JSON Structure

```json
{
  "task_id": "string",
  "status": "string", 
  "current_phase": "string (PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, TESTING, etc.)",
  "context": {
    "objective": "string",
    "phase_context": {
      "decisions": [/* Recent decisions with full detail */],
      "active_todos": [/* Current phase TODOs */],
      "recent_artifacts": [/* Phase-specific artifacts */]
    },
    "previous_phases_summary": "string (Compressed summary of completed phases)",
    "artifacts": ["string"],
    "dependencies": ["string"], 
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

This approach allows natural context growth within phases while preventing exponential growth across the entire project lifecycle.

## 7. Context Management Best Practices

### 7.1 Prompt Engineering for Context_Summarizer
- **Test Suite**: Maintain 5-10 complex TaskStory examples representing different scenarios
- **Validation**: Regularly test summarizer output against these examples  
- **Prevent Hallucination**: Ensure summarizer never adds information not present in original
- **Preserve Critical Details**: Method names, dependencies, user requirements must be retained

### 7.2 Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Batching**: Summarize every 3-4 handoffs instead of every single handoff
- **Smart Timing**: Heavy summarization only at phase boundaries
- **Budget Monitoring**: Alert when context management exceeds 10% of task cost
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to full context if summarizer fails

### 7.3 Recovery and Debugging
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all context operations and decisions
- **Version History**: Ability to rollback to previous TaskStory versions
- **Escape Hatch Usage**: Monitor and optimize context expansion requests
- **Quality Metrics**: Track information retention across summarization operations

### 7.4 Integration Guidelines
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing workflows continue to function
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test with subset of agents before full deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track context operation speed and success rates
- **User Experience**: Minimize impact on workflow execution time
