### Planned Feature: Iteration Approval Prompt in CLI
After exceeding the maximum allowed workflow iterations, the CLI will alert the user and request explicit approval before continuing with additional iterations. This will:
- Prevent runaway agent loops
- Allow human-in-the-loop intervention for long-running workflows
- Improve system safety and transparency

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Detect when the workflow exceeds the configured max_iterations.
2. In CLI mode, print a clear alert and prompt the user for approval to continue.
3. If approved, allow the workflow to proceed for a user-specified number of extra iterations.
4. If denied, terminate the workflow and log the event.
5. Add tests to verify CLI prompt and approval logic.

## 🔍 PHASE 1A & 1B IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS

### ✅ **PHASE 1A ASSESSMENT: EXCELLENT WORK**
**Overall Grade: A+ (95%)**

**What Was Done Right:**
1. **✅ Hardcoded Path Fixes** - PERFECT
   - `log_tools.py`: Clean implementation with PROJECT_ROOT detection and fallback to temp directory
   - `task_tools.py`: Same excellent pattern with permission error handling
   - No more hardcoded `c:\Users\a0526\DEV\Agents\logs` paths

2. **✅ Test Infrastructure** - OUTSTANDING
   - **271 passed, 6 skipped** - 97.8% pass rate (exceeds target of 87%)
   - Clean test output with only intentional skips
   - All permission errors eliminated

3. **✅ Error Handling** - ROBUST
   - Proper fallback mechanisms in both log_tools and task_tools
   - Graceful degradation when directories aren't accessible

**Minor Issues Found:**
- None significant - implementation exceeds requirements

### ✅ **PHASE 1B ASSESSMENT: GOOD FOUNDATION, NEEDS COMPLETION**
**Overall Grade: B+ (78%)**

**What Was Done Right:**
1. **✅ Registry Infrastructure** - SOLID
   - Added `AgentKnowledgeRegistry` with proper class structure
   - Enhanced `AgentFactory` with registry integration methods
   - Updated `EnhancedOrchestrator` to use registry instance

2. **✅ Integration Points** - GOOD
   - `set_knowledge_registry()` method properly injected
   - Registry validation and metadata caching added
   - Defensive programming in `get_agent_capabilities()`

3. **✅ Tool Discovery** - COMPREHENSIVE
   - Excellent tool capability definitions in `_discover_tools()`
   - 9 major tools properly documented with parameters, examples, metrics

**Issues That Need Fixing:**
1. **🔧 STUB METHODS** - Several critical methods are incomplete:
   ```python
   async def _discover_workflows(self):  # Partially implemented
   async def _discover_integrations(self):  # Empty stub
   async def _discover_knowledge_systems(self):  # Empty stub
   async def _build_agent_profiles(self):  # Empty stub
   ```

2. **🔧 MISSING INITIALIZATION** - Registry not actually initialized:
   - `AgentKnowledgeRegistry()` created but `initialize()` never called
   - Agent profiles remain empty, breaking agent capability queries

3. **🔧 INCOMPLETE ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION**:
   - Knowledge registry not passed to orchestration pipeline
   - No actual dynamic agent selection implemented yet

**Critical Missing Pieces:**
- Agent profiles building (empty `self.agent_profiles`)
- Integration discovery
- Knowledge system discovery
- Actual workflow requirements implementation

### 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA VERIFICATION**

**Phase 1A Criteria:**
- ✅ All tests pass without permission errors (271/277 = 97.8%)
- ✅ System initializes without hardcoded dependencies
- ✅ Logging system works with relative paths
- ✅ Zero "Access is denied" errors
- ✅ Comprehensive test cleanup system

**Phase 1B Criteria:**
- 🔧 Agent registry dynamically discovers agents (PARTIAL - needs profile building)
- 🔧 Agent factory creates agents based on registry data (PARTIAL - needs initialization)
- 🔧 Orchestrator selects agents dynamically (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- 🔧 All agent operations use registry-based discovery (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
