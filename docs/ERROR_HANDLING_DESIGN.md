# Error Handling System â€“ Status Update (July 2025)

## Implementation Gaps

- The checkpointing system exists, but there are serialization issues and not all error paths have been tested.
- Not all recovery paths are automatically tested; additional test coverage is needed.
- Predictive analytics, self-healing, and distributed checkpointing have not been implemented.
- Some advanced features (such as dashboard, alert system, and machine learning for error pattern recognition) are still missing.
- Documentation, monitoring, and user-facing error reporting need improvement.
