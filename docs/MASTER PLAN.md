### **Phase 1: Stabilization & Consolidation (The Great Cleanup) - âœ… COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Achieve a 100% stable, predictable, and consistent system by fixing all known bugs and unifying the architecture around our final decisions. This phase is critical and must be completed before any new features are added.

**Task 1.1: Fix All Critical Technical Issues**
*   **Objective:** Achieve a 100% passing test suite.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Resolve Dependency Conflict:** Add `pytest-asyncio` to `requirements.txt` and update any async tests to use the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator.
    2.  **Fix JSON Serialization Bug:** Implement the `.to_dict()` or `.to_json()` method in the `AgentDecision` class and any other non-serializable objects. Update all `json.dumps()` calls to use this method.
    3.  **Stabilize Performance Tests:** Adjust the timeout assertion in `test_agent_workflow.py` to a realistic value (e.g., `< 20 seconds`) to ensure it passes consistently.
    4.  **Harden Loop Prevention Logic:** Implement the improved loop detection logic in `smart_workflow_router.py` or `agent_driven_workflow.py` as previously discussed.
*   **Success Metric:** All 268+ tests pass reliably in a clean CI run.

**Task 1.2: Unify the Agent Prompting Strategy**
*   **Objective:** Fully implement the Dynamic & Optimized Prompting strategy.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Create Skill-Based Prompt Library:** Create a new directory `/prompts/skills`. Deconstruct the logic from the large agent `.md` files into small, reusable skill files (e.g., `tdd_methodology.md`, `code_readability_principles.md`).
    2.  **Refactor the Agent Factory:** Modify the `AgentFactory` to dynamically build short, task-specific prompts by combining a base role prompt with the relevant skill files.
    3.  **Archive Old Prompts:** Move all the long, static agent definition `.md` files (like `Coder.md`, `ask.md`, etc.) into an `/archive/legacy_prompts/` directory to prevent their use.
*   **Success Metric:** The average prompt size sent to the LLM API is reduced to under 100 tokens.

**Task 1.3: Consolidate Agent Roles & Documentation**
*   **Objective:** Create a single, undisputed source of truth for the team's structure.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Rewrite `Architect.md`:** Update the Architect's prompt file to reflect its new role as a decisive technical leader.
    2.  **Update `PLAN.md`:**
        *   Finalize the team roster to the official 15 agents.
        *   Update the role descriptions for the Architect and any other agents whose responsibilities were clarified.
    3.  **Update `README.md` and `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`:** Ensure the agent count and descriptions are consistent with the updated `PLAN.md`.
*   **Success Metric:** All core planning documents are 100% synchronized.

### **Phase 2: Implement Core Missing Systems**

**Goal:** Build and integrate the critical system components that are currently missing, turning the conceptual architecture into running code.

**Task 2.1: Fully Implement the Librarian Agent and its Services**
*   **Objective:** Make the Librarian the true central nervous system for documentation and memory.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Create `librarian_agent.py`:** Implement the agent class itself.
    2.  **Develop Core Librarian Tools:**
        *   `create_new_task(title, description)`: Generates a unique `TASK-ID` and creates the `tasks/TASK-XXX` directory structure.
        *   `record_event(event_type, details)`: Appends a structured entry to `event_log.jsonl`.
    3.  **Implement System-Assisted Handoff Packet Creation:**
        *   Create a new tool, `create_handoff_packet(simple_text_output)`.
        *   Update the Orchestrator's Agent Runner: after an agent returns its simple text output, the Runner calls this tool to generate the final, validated JSON Handoff Packet.
    4.  **Implement Semantic Indexing:**
        *   Integrate `ChromaDB` (or another local vector store).
        *   Create a process (triggered by the Librarian) that runs after a document is created, splits it into chunks, and indexes it in the vector store.
*   **Success Metric:** The Orchestrator no longer manages file paths or task IDs directly; it exclusively uses the Librarian's tools.

**Task 2.2: Implement the Integrator Agent**
*   **Objective:** Create a dedicated agent to handle the final "assembly" of a feature.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Create `integrator_agent.py`:** Define its role: "To take all artifacts from a completed feature and safely integrate them into the main project structure."
    2.  **Develop Integrator Tools:**
        *   `move_file(source, destination)`: Securely moves files.
        *   `fix_imports(file_path, project_root)`: Analyzes and corrects import paths in code files.
        *   `run_dependency_check()`: Runs `pip check` or `npm audit` to ensure dependencies are compatible.
    3.  **Integrate into Workflow:** Add a new, final stage to the workflows. After the `QA_Guardian` approves a feature, the **Conductor** assigns a new task: "Integrate feature `TASK-XXX` into the main codebase," to the **Integrator**.
*   **Success Metric:** The `src/` directory is only ever modified by the Integrator agent, ensuring a clean and controlled main codebase.

**Task 2.3: Implement the Enhanced Git Context Tool**
*   **Objective:** Provide agents with a deeper understanding of the project's current state.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Create `get_git_context()` tool:** This tool will run `git status` and `git diff --staged` and parse the output into a clean, summarized text format.
    2.  **Assign Tool:** Grant access to this new tool to the **Coder**, **Debugger**, and **Code Reviewer** agents.
    3.  **Update Prompts:** Add instructions for these agents on how to use the new tool to inform their work (e.g., "Before writing code, use `get_git_context()` to understand what has already been changed.").
*   **Success Metric:** Agents begin to reference the git status in their reasoning logs (`execution.log`).

### **Phase 3: System Hardening and Future-Proofing (Project Horizon)**

**Goal:** Evolve the stable system into a mature, resilient, and intelligent platform. This phase implements the `Project Horizon` roadmap.

**Task 3.1: Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage (The Safety Net)**
*   **Objective:** Ensure all future changes can be made safely.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  Write **unit tests** for every tool in the `/tools` directory.
    2.  Write **integration tests** for key agent handoffs (e.g., Analyst -> Coder).
    3.  Write **unit tests** for the Orchestrator's routing logic using mock Handoff Packets.
    4.  Set up a **GitHub Actions CI pipeline** that runs all tests on every push.
*   **Success Metric:** Test coverage reaches >90%, and the CI pipeline is active.

**Task 3.2: Implement Self-Improvement and Memory**
*   **Objective:** Enable the system to learn from its experience.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  **Create the Solutions Archive:** Implement the Librarian logic to identify and save key artifacts to a `/knowledge_base/solutions` directory.
    2.  **Implement the System Health Agent:** Create a new agent that runs post-project, analyzes logs for performance trends (task duration, failure rates), and generates a `health_report.md`.
*   **Success Metric:** The system can successfully complete a task by referencing a solution from a previous, unrelated project run.

**Task 3.3: Implement Web Capabilities**
*   **Objective:** Allow agents to access external knowledge.
*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    1.  Build the secure `browse_web(url)` and `web_search(query)` tools.
    2.  Update prompts for relevant agents (Coder, Architect) with instructions on when it's appropriate to search the web.
*   **Success Metric:** An agent can successfully use a new, undocumented library by finding its documentation online.
